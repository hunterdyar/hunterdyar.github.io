            <p>No longer available online, sadly. I created an interactive choose-your-own-adventure podcast where the episodes pushed to the unique feed were determined by choices you made, selecting links in the podcast description. The underlying system handled basic branching narratives. The story I produced kept the story events fixed, but the perspective would alter as you chose different narrators - and different versions of the events unfolded.</p>

          <p>Pointless, non-narrative videos to practice editing video, since I like making videos but don't often get a chance to. I also explore using bare bones equipment (editing on an ipad, shooting on phones and sports cams, etc). It began when I forced myself to make a vlog-ish-style video every day for a few weeks. I don't recommend watching these <a href="https://vimeo.com/user49329901">here.</a></p>

            <h5>The Cauldron - DePauw Campus Magazine</h5>
            <p>Back in undergrad I was the editor-in-chief of a magazine. It may not look like much, but I promise it was well above-average in terms of college undergraduate arts magazines, appropriately remembered fondly by staff and faculty. <a href="http://hdyar.com/media/CauldronOctober2014.pdf">Here</a> is an issue, for the curious.</p>

              <p><a href="http://charlotteshow.tumblr.com">The Charlotte Show</a> was a weekly comedy radio show that we produced. The Charlotte Show combined live and improvised entertainment with written and recorded (ie: produced) sketch comedy audio (which was also published as a podcast). It was probably the most time consuming yet entertaining thing I did as an undergraduate, and it's a shame a better archive of the material doesn't exist, most of the audio files have gone offline somewhere when we stopped paying to host the podcast.</p>

              <p>This project was me looking at how to embrace strange photogrammetry artifacts. Instead of creating <a href="http://www.clairesophie.com/catacombs-i/">entrancing beauty</a> with it, I decided to stick to more terrifying aesthetic, and try to create an environment that one might find in a horror experience. No scares, just the environment. Using filmic cues in VR was enjoyable. This project included a VR build for oculus, Binaural recordings of a train, and a 'butt kicker', a bass transducer that we surreptitiously attached to the bottom of the users chair. The video does not do justice at just how well we were able to unnerve many of those who tried it.</p>
